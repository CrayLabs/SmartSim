        and executed.

        ``Model`` instances can be launched sequentially, as a batch job,
        or as a group by adding them into an ``Ensemble``.

        All ``Models`` require a reference to run settings to specify which
        executable to launch as well provide options for how to launch
        the executable with the underlying WLM. Furthermore, batch a
        reference to a batch settings can be added to launch the ``Model``
        as a batch job through ``Experiment.start``. If a ``Model`` with
        a reference to a set of batch settings is added to a larger
        entity with its own set of batch settings (for e.g. an
        ``Ensemble``) the batch settings of the larger entity will take
        precedence and the batch setting of the ``Model`` will be
        strategically ignored.

        Parameters supplied in the `params` argument can be written into
        configuration files supplied at runtime to the ``Model`` through
        ``Model.attach_generator_files``. `params` can also be turned
        into executable arguments by calling ``Model.params_to_args``

        By default, ``Model`` instances will be executed in the
        exp_path/model_name directory if no `path` argument is supplied.
        If a ``Model`` instance is passed to ``Experiment.generate``,
        a directory within the ``Experiment`` directory will be created
        to house the input and output files from the ``Model``.

        Example initialization of a ``Model`` instance

        .. highlight:: python
        .. code-block:: python

            from smartsim import Experiment
            run_settings = exp.create_run_settings("python", "run_pytorch_model.py")
            model = exp.create_model("pytorch_model", run_settings)

            # adding parameters to a model
            run_settings = exp.create_run_settings("python", "run_pytorch_model.py")
            train_params = {
                "batch": 32,
                "epoch": 10,

        New in 0.4.0, ``Model`` instances can be colocated with an
        FeatureStore feature store shard through ``Model.colocate_fs``. This
        will launch a single ``FeatureStore`` instance on each compute
        host used by the (possibly distributed) application. This is
        useful for performant online inference or processing
        at runtime.

        New in 0.4.2, ``Model`` instances can now be colocated with
        an FeatureStore feature store over either TCP or UDS using the
        ``Model.colocate_fs_tcp`` or ``Model.colocate_fs_uds`` method
        respectively. The original ``Model.colocate_fs`` method is now
        deprecated, but remains as an alias for ``Model.colocate_fs_tcp``
        for backward compatibility.
