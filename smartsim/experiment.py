    """Experiments are the Python user interface for SmartSim.

    Experiment is a factory class that creates stages of a workflow
    and manages their execution.

    The instances created by an Experiment represent executable code
    that is either user-specified, like the ``Model`` instance created
    by ``Experiment.create_model``, or pre-configured, like the ``Orchestrator``
    instance created by ``Experiment.create_database``.

    Experiment methods that accept a variable list of arguments, such as
    ``Experiment.start`` or ``Experiment.stop``, accept any number of the
    instances created by the Experiment.

    In general, the Experiment class is designed to be initialized once
    and utilized throughout runtime.

        The ``Model`` class is the most general encapsulation of
        executable code in SmartSim. ``Model`` instances are named
        references to pieces of a workflow that can be parameterized,
        and executed.

        ``Model`` instances can be launched sequentially, as a batch job,
        or as a group by adding them into an ``Ensemble``.

        All models require a reference to run settings to specify which
        executable to launch as well provide options for how to launch
        the executable with the underlying WLM. Furthermore, batch a
        reference to a batch settings can be added to launch the model
        as a batch job through ``Experiment.start``. If a model with
        a reference to a set of batch settings is added to a larger
        entity with its own set of batch settings (for e.g. an
        ``Ensemble``) the batch settings of the larger entity will take
        precedence and the batch setting of the model will be
        strategically ignored.

        Parameters supplied in the `params` argument can be written into
        configuration files supplied at runtime to the model through
        ``Model.attach_generator_files``. `params` can also be turned
        into executable arguments by calling ``Model.params_to_args``

        By default, ``Model`` instances will be executed in the
        current working directory if no `path` argument is supplied.
        If a ``Model`` instance is passed to ``Experiment.generate``,
        a directory within the ``Experiment`` directory will be created
        to house the input and output files from the model.

        host used by the (possibly distributed) application. This is
        useful for performant online inference or processing
        at runtime.
