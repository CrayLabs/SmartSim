**SmartSim enables scientists to utilize machine learning inside traditional HPC workloads**

SmartSim provides this capability by

 1. Automating the deployment of HPC workloads and distributed, in-memory storage (Redis).
 2. Making TensorFlow, Pytorch, and ONNX callable from Fortran, C, and C++ simulations.
 3. Providing flexible data communication and formats for hierarchical data, enabling online
    analysis, visualization, and processing of simulation data.

The main goal of SmartSim is to provide scientists a flexible, easy to use method for
interacting at runtime with the data generated by simulation. The type of interaction
is completely up to the user.

 - Embed calls to machine learning models inside a simulation
 - Create hooks to manually or programmatically steer a simulation
 - Visualize the progression of a simulation integration from a Jupyter notebook

The figure below shows the architecture of SmartSim for a given use case.
SmartSim can create, configure and launch workloads (called a ``Model``),
as well as groups of workloads (``Ensembles``). The data communication between
a workload and in-memory storage is handled by the SmartRedis clients, available
in Fortran, C, C++, and Python.

Library Design
==============

There are two core components of SmartSim:

  1. SmartSim (infrastructure library)
  2. SmartRedis (client library)

The two libraries can either be used in conjunction or separately, depending
on the needs of the user.

SmartSim (infrastructure library)
---------------------------------

The infrastructure library (IL) provides an API to automate the process of
deploying HPC workloads alongside an in-memory database: Redis.

The key features of the IL are:

  - An API to start, monitor, and stop HPC jobs from Python or from a Jupyter notebook.
  - Automated deployment of in-memory data staging (`Redis <https://redis.io>`_) and computational
    storage (`RedisAI <https://redisai.io>`_).
  - Programmatic launches of batch and in-allocation jobs on PBS, Slurm, and LSF systems.
  - Creating and configuring ensembles of workloads with isolated communication channels.

The IL can configure and launch batch jobs as well as jobs within interactive
allocations. The IL integrates with workload managers, (like Slurm and PBS),
if it is running on a supercomputer or cluster system.

The IL can deploy a distributed, shared-nothing, in-memory cluster of Redis
instances across multiple compute nodes of a supercomputer, cluster, or laptop.
In SmartSim, this clustered Redis deployment is called the ``Orchestrator``.

By coupling the Orchestrator with HPC applications, users can connect their
workloads to other applications, like trained machine learning models, with
the SmartRedis clients.
