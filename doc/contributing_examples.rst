What Is the SmartSim Zoo?
=========================
Given that SmartSim is a community developed and maintained project, we have introduced
a `SmartSim Example Zoo <https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim-Zoo>`_ that contains CrayLabs and user contributed examples of using SmartSim
for various simulation and machine learning applications.

How To Contribute
=================
We support, encourage, and welcome all contributions to the `SmartSim Zoo <https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim-Zoo>`_ repository. If you would
like to contribute an example, please checkout the SmartSim Zoo GitHub repository `here <https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim-Zoo>`_, and follow the steps to
inclusion in the SmartSim Zoo. For your contribution to be included, we ask that you include a description and all references to code and
relevant previous implementations or open source code that the work is based off of for the benefit of anyone who would like to try out your example.

Existing Examples
=================
The SmartSim Zoo contains examples based on research papers, simulation models, and High Performance Computing Systems.
A more detailed and comprehensive list of existing examples can be found in the `SmartSim Zoo <https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim-Zoo>`_.
