# Online Analysis of Lattice Botzmann Simulations

This example was adapted from [Philip Mocz's implementation](https://github.com/pmocz/latticeboltzmann-python)
of the lattice Boltzmann method in Python. Since that example is licensed under GPL, so is this example.

A great medium article explaining the simulation can be found
[here](https://medium.com/swlh/create-your-own-lattice-boltzmann-simulation-with-python-8759e8b53b1c)

The full documentation for this example can be found in the
[SmartSim documentation](https://www.craylabs.org/docs/) under the tutorials section.
