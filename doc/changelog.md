Detailed Notes

-   The tutorials are up-to date with SmartSim and SmartRedis APIs. Additionally,
    the tutorial containers' Docker files are updated. ([SmartSim-PR589](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/589))
-   The Dragon server will now terminate any process which is still running
    when a request of an immediate shutdown is sent. ([SmartSim-PR582](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/582))
-   Add `--dragon` option to `smart build`. Install appropriate Dragon
    runtime from Dragon GitHub release assets.
    ([SmartSim-PR580](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/580))
-   Add new launcher, based on [Dragon](https://dragonhpc.github.io/dragon/doc/_build/html/index.html).
    The new launcher is compatible with the Slurm and PBS schedulers and can
    be selected by specifying ``launcher="dragon"`` when creating an `Experiment`,
    or by using ``DragonRunSettings`` to launch a job. The Dragon launcher
    is at an early stage of development: early adopters are referred to the
    dedicated documentation section to learn more about it. ([SmartSim-PR580](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/580))
-   Tests may now request a given configuration and will reconnect to
    the existing orchestrator instead of building up and tearing down
    a new one each test.
    ([SmartSim-PR567](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/567))
-   Manually ensure that typing_extensions==4.6.1 in Dockerfile used to build
    docs. This fixes the deploy_dev_docs Github action ([SmartSim-PR564](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/564))
-   Added preview functionality to Experiment, including preview of all entities, active infrastructure and
    client configuration. ([SmartSim-PR525](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/525))
-   Replace the developer created token with the GH_TOKEN environment variable.
    ([SmartSim-PR570](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/570))
-   Add extension to auto-generate function type-hints into documentation.
    ([SmartSim-PR561](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/561))
-   Add to github release workflow to auto generate a pull request from
    master into develop for release.
    ([SmartSim-PR566](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/566))
-   The manifest.json version needs to match the SmartDashboard version,
    which is 0.0.4 in the upcoming release.
    ([SmartSim-PR563](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/563))
-   Properly symlinks batch ensembles and batch models.
    ([SmartSim-PR547](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/547))
-   Remove defensive regexp in .gitignore and ensure tests write to
    test_output.
    ([SmartSim-PR560](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/560))
-   After dropping support for Python 3.8, ubuntu needs to be upgraded.
    ([SmartSim-PR558](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/558))
-   Remove helper function `init_default` and replace with traditional
    type narrowing.
    ([SmartSim-PR545](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/545))
-   Ensure the telemetry monitor does not track a task_id for a managed
    task.
    ([SmartSim-PR557](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/557))
-   The default path for an entity is now the path to the experiment /
    the entity name. create_database and create_ensemble now have path
    arguments. All path arguments are compatible with relative paths.
    Relative paths are relative to the CWD.
    ([SmartSim-PR533](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/533))
-   Python 3.8 is reaching its end-of-life in October, 2024, so it will
    no longer continue to be supported.
    ([SmartSim-PR544](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/544))
-   Update watchdog dependency from 3.x to 4.x, fix new type issues
    ([SmartSim-PR540](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/540))
-   The dashboard needs to display historical logs, so log files are
    written out under the .smartsim directory and files under the
    experiment directory are symlinked to them.
    ([SmartSim-PR532](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/532))
-   Add an option to smart build
    \"\--torch_with_mkl\"/\"\--no_torch_with_mkl\" to prevent Torch from
    trying to link in the Intel Math Kernel Library. This is needed
    because on machines that have the Intel compilers installed, the
    Torch will unconditionally try to link in this library, however
    fails because the linking flags are incorrect.
    ([SmartSim-PR538](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/538))
-   Change typing\_extensions and pydantic versions in readthedocs
    environment to enable docs build.
    ([SmartSim-PR537](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/537))
-   Promote devices to a dedicated Enum type throughout the SmartSim
    code base.
    ([SmartSim-PR527](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/527))
-   Update the telemetry monitor to enable retrieval of metrics on a
    scheduled interval. Switch basic experiment tracking telemetry to
    default to on. Add database metric collectors. Improve telemetry
    monitor logging. Create telemetry subpackage at
    [smartsim.\_core.utils.telemetry]{.title-ref}. Refactor telemetry
    monitor entrypoint.
    ([SmartSim-PR460](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/460))
-   Users can now specify node features for a Slurm job through
    `SrunSettings.set_node_feature`. The method accepts a string or list
    of strings.
    ([SmartSim-PR529](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/529))
-   The request to the colocated entrypoints file within the shell
    script is now a blocking process. Once the Orchestrator is setup, it
    returns which moves the process to the background and allows the
    application to start. This prevents the application from requesting
    a ML model or script that has not been uploaded to the Orchestrator
    yet.
    ([SmartSim-PR522](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/522))
-   Add checks and tests to ensure SmartSim users cannot initialize run
    settings with a list of lists as the exe_args argument.
    ([SmartSim-PR517](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/517))
-   Add readthedocs configuration file and enable readthedocs builds on
    pull requests. Additionally added robots.txt file generation when
    readthedocs environment detected.
    ([SmartSim-PR512](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/512))
-   Add Github Actions workflow that checks if changelog is edited on
    pull requests into develop.
    ([SmartSim-PR518](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/518))
-   Add path to MathJax.js file so that Sphinx will use to render math
    expressions.
    ([SmartSim-PR516](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/516))
-   Removed deprecated SmartSim modules: slurm and mpirunSettings.
    ([SmartSim-PR514](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/514))
-   Implemented new structure of SmartSim documentation. Added examples
    images and further detail of SmartSim components.
    ([SmartSim-PR463](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/463))
-   Promote SmartSim statuses to a dedicated type named SmartSimStatus.
    ([SmartSim-PR509](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/509))
-   Update Redis version to [7.2.4]{.title-ref}. This change fixes an
    issue in the Redis build scripts causing failures on Apple Silicon
    hosts.
    ([SmartSim-PR507](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/507))
-   The container which builds the documentation for every merge to
    develop was failing due to a lack of space within the container.
    This was fixed by including an additional Github action that removes
    some unneeded software and files that come from the default Github
    Ubuntu container.
    ([SmartSim-PR504](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/504))
-   Update the generic [t.Any]{.title-ref} typehints in Experiment API.
    ([SmartSim-PR501](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/501))
-   The CI will fail static analysis if common erroneous truthy checks
    are detected.
    ([SmartSim-PR524](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/524))
-   Prevent the launch of duplicate named entities. Allow completed
    entities to run.
    ([SmartSim-PR480](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/480))
-   The CI will fail static analysis if a local variable used while
    potentially undefined.
    ([SmartSim-PR521](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/521))
-   Remove previously deprecated behavior present in test suite on
    machines with Slurm and Open MPI.
    ([SmartSim-PR520](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/520))
-   Experiments in the WLM tests are given explicit paths to prevent
    unexpected directory creation. Ensure database are not left open on
    test suite failures. Update path to pickle file in
    `tests/full_wlm/test_generic_orc_launch_batch.py::test_launch_cluster_orc_reconnect`
    to conform with changes made in
    ([SmartSim-PR533](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/533)).
    ([SmartSim-PR559](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/559))
-   When calling `Experiment.start` SmartSim would register a signal
    handler that would capture an interrupt signal (\^C) to kill any
    jobs launched through its `JobManager`. This would replace the
    default (or user defined) signal handler. SmartSim will now attempt
    to kill any launched jobs before calling the previously registered
    signal handler.
    ([SmartSim-PR535](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/535))

-   Bug fix which prevents the expected behavior when the
    [SMARTSIM_LOG_LEVEL]{.title-ref} environment variable was set to
    [developer]{.title-ref}.
    ([SmartSim-PR473](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/473))
-   Sets the default value of the \"enable telemetry\" flag to on. Bumps
    the output [manifest.json]{.title-ref} version number to match that
    of [smartdashboard]{.title-ref} and pins a watchdog version to avoid
    build errors.
    ([SmartSim-PR477](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/477))
-   Refactor logic of [Manifest.has_db_objects]{.title-ref} to remove

Detailed Notes

-   Several conflicting directives between the [setup.py]{.title-ref}
    and the [setup.cfg]{.title-ref} were fixed to mitigate warnings
    issued when building the pip wheel.
    ([SmartSim-PR435](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/435))
-   When the Slurm functions [sacct]{.title-ref} and [sstat]{.title-ref}
    returned an error, it would be ignored and SmartSim\'s state could
    become inconsistent. To prevent this, errors raised by
    [sacct]{.title-ref} or [sstat]{.title-ref} now result in an
    exception.
    ([SmartSim-PR392](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/392))
-   A section named *ML Features* was added to documentation. It
    contains multiple examples of how ML models and functions can be
    added to and executed on the DB. TorchScript-based post-processing
    was added to the *Online Analysis* tutorial
    ([SmartSim-PR411](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/411))
-   An example of how to use multiple Orchestrators concurrently was
    added to the documentation
    ([SmartSim-PR409](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/409))
-   The test infrastructure was improved. Tests on HPC system are now
    stable, and issues such as non-stopped [Orchestrators]{.title-ref}
    or experiments created in the wrong paths have been fixed
    ([SmartSim-PR381](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/381))
-   A telemetry monitor was added to check updates and produce events
    for SmartDashboard
    ([SmartSim-PR426](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/426))
-   Split tests into [group_a]{.title-ref}, [group_b]{.title-ref},
    [slow_tests]{.title-ref} for parallel execution in CI/CD pipeline
    ([SmartSim-PR417](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/417),
    [SmartSim-PR424](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/424))
-   Change [format]{.title-ref} argument to [style]{.title-ref} in
    [Experiment.summary()]{.title-ref}, this is an API break
    ([SmartSim-PR391](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/391))
-   Added support for first_device parameter for scripts, functions, and
    models. This causes them to be loaded to the first num_devices
    beginning with first_device
    ([SmartSim-PR394](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/394))
-   Added support for MINBATCHTIMEOUT in model execution, which caps the
    delay waiting for a minimium number of model execution operations to
    accumulate before executing them as a batch
    ([SmartSim-PR387](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/387))
-   RedisAI 1.2.5 is not supported anymore. The only RedisAI version is
    now 1.2.7. Since the officially released RedisAI 1.2.7 has a bug
    which breaks the build process on Mac OSX, it was decided to use
    commit
    [634916c](https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/commit/634916c722e718cc6ea3fad46e63f7d798f9adc2)
    from RedisAI\'s GitHub repository, where such bug has been fixed.
    This applies to all operating systems.
    ([SmartSim-PR383](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/383))
-   Add support for creation of multiple databases with unique
    identifiers.

### 0.4.2

Released on April 12, 2023

Description

This release of SmartSim had a focus on polishing and extending exiting
features already provided by SmartSim. Most notably, this release
provides support to allow users to colocate their models with an
orchestrator using Unix domain sockets and support for launching models
as batch jobs.

Additionally, SmartSim has updated its tool chains to provide a better
user experience. Notably, SmarSim can now be used with Python 3.10,
Redis 7.0.5, and RedisAI 1.2.7. Furthermore, SmartSim now utilizes
SmartRedis\'s aggregation lists to streamline the use and extension of
ML data loaders, making working with popular machine learning frameworks
in SmartSim a breeze.

A full list of changes and detailed notes can be found below:

-   Add support for colocating an orchestrator over UDS
-   Add support for Python 3.10, deprecate support for Python 3.7 and
    RedisAI 1.2.3
-   Drop support for Ray
-   Update ML data loaders to make use of SmartRedis\'s aggregation
    lists
-   Allow for models to be launched independently as batch jobs
-   Update to current version of Redis to 7.0.5
-   Add support for RedisAI 1.2.7, pyTorch 1.11.0, Tensorflow 2.8.0,
    ONNXRuntime 1.11.1
-   Fix bug in colocated database entrypoint when loading PyTorch models
-   Fix test suite behavior with environment variables

Detailed Notes

-   Running some tests could result in some SmartSim-specific
    environment variables to be set. Such environment variables are now
    reset after each test execution. Also, a warning for environment
    variable usage in Slurm was added, to make the user aware in case an
    environment variable will not be assigned the desired value with
    [\--export]{.title-ref}.
    ([SmartSim-PR270](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/270))
-   The PyTorch and TensorFlow data loaders were update to make use of
    aggregation lists. This breaks their API, but makes them easier to
    use.
    ([SmartSim-PR264](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/264))
-   The support for Ray was dropped, as its most recent versions caused
    problems when deployed through SmartSim. We plan to release a
    separate add-on library to accomplish the same results. If you are
    interested in getting the Ray launch functionality back in your
    workflow, please get in touch with us!
    ([SmartSim-PR263](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/263))
-   Update from Redis version 6.0.8 to 7.0.5.
    ([SmartSim-PR258](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/258))
-   Adds support for Python 3.10 without the ONNX machine learning
    backend. Deprecates support for Python 3.7 as it will stop receiving
    security updates. Deprecates support for RedisAI 1.2.3. Update the
    build process to be able to correctly fetch supported dependencies.
    If a user attempts to build an unsupported dependency, an error
    message is shown highlighting the discrepancy.
    ([SmartSim-PR256](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/256))
-   Models were given a [batch_settings]{.title-ref} attribute. When
    launching a model through [Experiment.start]{.title-ref} the
    [Experiment]{.title-ref} will first check for a non-nullish value at
    that attribute. If the check is satisfied, the
    [Experiment]{.title-ref} will attempt to wrap the underlying run
    command in a batch job using the object referenced at
    [Model.batch_settings]{.title-ref} as the batch settings for the
    job. If the check is not satisfied, the [Model]{.title-ref} is
    launched in the traditional manner as a job step.
    ([SmartSim-PR245](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/245))
-   Fix bug in colocated database entrypoint stemming from uninitialized
    variables. This bug affects PyTorch models being loaded into the
    database.
    ([SmartSim-PR237](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/237))
-   The release of RedisAI 1.2.7 allows us to update support for recent
    versions of PyTorch, Tensorflow, and ONNX
    ([SmartSim-PR234](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/234))
-   Make installation of correct Torch backend more reliable according
    to instruction from PyTorch
-   In addition to TCP, add UDS support for colocating an orchestrator
    with models. Methods [Model.colocate_db_tcp]{.title-ref} and
    [Model.colocate_db_uds]{.title-ref} were added to expose this
    functionality. The [Model.colocate_db]{.title-ref} method remains
    and uses TCP for backward compatibility
    ([SmartSim-PR246](https://github.com/CrayLabs/SmartSim/pull/246))

### 0.4.1

Released on June 24, 2022

Description: This release of SmartSim introduces a new experimental
feature to help make SmartSim workflows more portable: the ability to
run simulations models in a container via Singularity. This feature has
been tested on a small number of platforms and we encourage users to
provide feedback on its use.

We have also made improvements in a variety of areas: new utilities to
load scripts and machine learning models into the database directly from
SmartSim driver scripts and install-time choice to use either
[KeyDB]{.title-ref} or [Redis]{.title-ref} for the Orchestrator. The
[RunSettings]{.title-ref} API is now more consistent across subclasses.
Another key focus of this release was to aid new SmartSim users by
including more extensive tutorials and improving the documentation. The
docker image containing the SmartSim tutorials now also includes a
tutorial on online training.
