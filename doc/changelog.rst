To be released at some future date

Note

This section details changes made in the development branch that have not yet
been applied to a released version of the SmartSim library.

Description

A full list of changes and detailed notes can be found below:

- Remove wait time associated with Experiment launch summary
- Update and rename Redis conf file
- Migrate from redis-py-cluster to redis-py

- Update doc strings
- Remove deprecated code
- Relax the coloredlogs version
- Update Fortran tutorials for SmartRedis
- Add support for multiple network interface binding in Orchestrator and Colocated DBs
- Add typehints and static analysis

Detailed notes

- Typehints have been added. A makefile target `make check-mypy` executes static
  analysis with mypy. (PR295_, PR303_)
- Simplify code in `random_permutations` parameter generation strategy (PR300_)
- Remove wait time associated with Experiment launch summary (PR298_)
- Update Redis conf file to conform with Redis v7.0.5 conf file (PR293_)
- Migrate from redis-py-cluster to redis-py for cluster status checks (PR292_)
- Update full test suite to no longer require a tensorflow wheel to be available
  at test time. (PR291_)
- Correct spelling of colocated in doc strings (PR290_)
- Deprecated launcher-specific orchestrators, constants, and ML 
  utilities were removed. (PR289_)
- Relax the coloredlogs version to be greater than 10.0 (PR288_)
- Update the Github Actions runner image from `macos-10.15`` to `macos-12``. The
  former began deprecation in May 2022 and was finally removed in May 2023. (PR285_)
- The Fortran tutorials had not been fully updated to show how to handle 
  return/error codes. These have now all been updated. (PR284_)
- Orchestrator and Colocated DB now accept a list of interfaces to bind to. The 
  argument name is still `interface` for backward compatibility reasons. (PR281_)

0.4.2
-----

Released on April 12, 2023

Description

This release of SmartSim had a focus on polishing and extending exiting
features already provided by SmartSim. Most notably, this release provides
support to allow users to colocate their models with an orchestrator using
Unix domain sockets and support for launching models as batch jobs.

Additionally, SmartSim has updated its tool chains to provide a better user
experience. Notably, SmarSim can now be used with Python 3.10, Redis 7.0.5, and
RedisAI 1.2.7. Furthermore, SmartSim now utilizes SmartRedis's aggregation lists to
streamline the use and extension of ML data loaders, making working with popular
machine learning frameworks in SmartSim a breeze.

A full list of changes and detailed notes can be found below:

- Add support for colocating an orchestrator over UDS
- Add support for Python 3.10, deprecate support for Python 3.7 and RedisAI 1.2.3
- Drop support for Ray
- Update ML data loaders to make use of SmartRedis's aggregation lists
- Allow for models to be launched independently as batch jobs
- Update to current version of Redis to 7.0.5
- Add support for RedisAI 1.2.7, pyTorch 1.11.0, Tensorflow 2.8.0, ONNXRuntime 1.11.1
- Fix bug in colocated database entrypoint when loading PyTorch models
- Fix test suite behavior with environment variables

Detailed Notes

- Running some tests could result in some SmartSim-specific environment variables to be set. Such environment variables are now reset
  after each test execution. Also, a warning for environment variable usage in Slurm was added, to make the user aware in case an environment
  variable will not be assigned the desired value with `--export`. (PR270_)
- The PyTorch and TensorFlow data loaders were update to make use of aggregation lists. This breaks their API, but makes them easier to use. (PR264_)
- The support for Ray was dropped, as its most recent versions caused problems when deployed through SmartSim.
  We plan to release a separate add-on library to accomplish the same results. If
  you are interested in getting the Ray launch functionality back in your workflow, please get in touch with us! (PR263_)
- Update from Redis version 6.0.8 to 7.0.5. (PR258_)
- Adds support for Python 3.10 without the ONNX machine learning backend. Deprecates support for
  Python 3.7 as it will stop receiving security updates. Deprecates support for RedisAI 1.2.3.
  Update the build process to be able to correctly fetch supported dependencies. If a user
  attempts to build an unsupported dependency, an error message is shown highlighting the
  discrepancy. (PR256_)
- Models were given a `batch_settings` attribute. When launching a model through `Experiment.start`
  the `Experiment` will first check for a non-nullish value at that attribute. If the check is
  satisfied, the `Experiment` will attempt to wrap the underlying run command in a batch job using
  the object referenced at `Model.batch_settings` as the batch settings for the job. If the check
  is not satisfied, the `Model` is launched in the traditional manner as a job step. (PR245_)
- Fix bug in colocated database entrypoint stemming from uninitialized variables. This bug affects PyTorch models being loaded into the database. (PR237_)
- The release of RedisAI 1.2.7 allows us to update support for recent versions of PyTorch, Tensorflow, and ONNX (PR234_)
- Make installation of correct Torch backend more reliable according to instruction from PyTorch
- In addition to TCP, add UDS support for colocating an orchestrator with models. Methods
  `Model.colocate_db_tcp` and `Model.colocate_db_uds` were added to expose this functionality.
  The `Model.colocate_db` method remains and uses TCP for backward compatibility (PR246_)

0.4.1
-----

Released on June 24, 2022

Description:
This release of SmartSim introduces a new experimental feature to help make
SmartSim workflows more portable: the ability to run simulations models in a
container via Singularity. This feature has been tested on a small number of
platforms and we encourage users to provide feedback on its use.

We have also made improvements in a variety of areas: new utilities to load
scripts and machine learning models into the database directly from SmartSim
driver scripts and install-time choice to use either `KeyDB` or `Redis` for the
Orchestrator. The `RunSettings` API is now more consistent across subclasses. Another
key focus of this release was to aid new SmartSim users by including more
extensive tutorials and improving the documentation. The docker image containing
the SmartSim tutorials now also includes a tutorial on online training.


Launcher improvements

    - New methods for specifying `RunSettings` parameters (SmartSim-PR166_) (SmartSim-PR170_)
    - Better support for `mpirun`, `mpiexec`, and `orterun` as launchers (SmartSim-PR186_)
    - Experimental: add support for running models via Singularity (SmartSim-PR204_)

Documentation and tutorials

    - Tutorial updates (SmartSim-PR155_) (SmartSim-PR203_) (SmartSim-PR208_)
    - Add SmartSim Zoo info to documentation (SmartSim-PR175_)
    - New tutorial for demonstrating online training (SmartSim-PR176_) (SmartSim-PR188_)

General improvements and bug fixes

0.4.0
-----

Released on Feb 11, 2022

Description:
In this release SmartSim continues to promote ease of use.
To this end SmartSim has introduced new portability features
that allow users to abstract away their targeted hardware,
while providing even more compatibility with existing
libraries.

A new feature, Co-located orchestrator deployments has
been added which provides scalable online inference
capabilities that overcome previous performance limitations
in seperated orchestrator/application deployments.
For more information on advantages of co-located deployments,
see the Orchestrator section of the SmartSim documentation.

The SmartSim build was significantly improved to increase
customization of build toolchain and the ``smart`` command
line inferface was expanded.

Additional tweaks and upgrades have also been
made to ensure an optimal experience. Here is a
