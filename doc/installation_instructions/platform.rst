Platform Install Guide
======================

HPC platforms have specific modules that users can often use so they do not
need to retrieve all of the build dependencies themselves. Some machines
have specific environment variables and/or configuration settings that need
to be set for optimal performance. The below machines have vetted
instructions, please feel free to contribute instructions for your own
machine.
