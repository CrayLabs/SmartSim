SmartSim has been installed on a variety of systems and our users often have
different build environments and toolchains. The following two sections detail
some common situations and how to setup and modify your build environment:

Installation guides for specific platforms
==========================================

HPC platforms have specific modules that users can often use so they do not
need to retrieve all of the build dependencies themselves. Some machines
have specific environment variables and/or configuration settings that need
to be set for optimal performance. The below machines have vetted
instructions, please feel free to contribute instructions for your own
machine.
