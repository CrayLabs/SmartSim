    this test can run on CPU/GPU by setting SMARTSIM_TEST_DEVICE=GPU
    Similarly, the test can excute on any launcher by setting SMARTSIM_TEST_LAUNCHER
    which is local by default.

    Currently SmartSim only runs ONNX on GPU if libm.so with GLIBC_2.27 is present
    on the system. See: https://github.com/RedisAI/RedisAI/issues/826
