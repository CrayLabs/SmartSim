"""
Test the launch and stop of simple models and ensembles that use base
RunSettings while on WLM that do not include a run command

These tests will execute code (very light scripts) on the head node
as no run command will exec them out onto the compute nodes

the reason we test this is because we want to make sure that each
WLM launcher also supports the ability to run scripts on the head node
that also contain an invoking run command
