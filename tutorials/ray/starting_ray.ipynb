    "When the Ray job is running, we can connect to the Ray dashboard to monitor the evolution of the experiment. To do this, if Ray is running on a compute node of a remote system, we need to setup a SSH tunnel (we will see later how), to forward the port on which the dashboard is published to our local system. For example, if the head address (printed in the cell above) is `<head_ip_address>`, and the system name is `<remote_sytem_name>`, we can establish a tunnel to the dashboard opening a terminal on the local system and entering:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. If the port forwarding fails, it is possible that the interface is not reachable. In that case, you can add `\"dashboard-address\": \"0.0.0.0\"` to `ray_args` when creating the cluster, to bind the dashboard to all interfaces, or select a visible address if one knows it. You can then use the node name (or its public IP) to establish the tunnel, by entering (on the local terminal):\n",
