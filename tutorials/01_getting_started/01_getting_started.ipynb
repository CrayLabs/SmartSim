Unless we used unique keys across the running programs, several tensors (or objects) would have the same key, and this key collision would result in unexpected behavior. In other words, if in the source code of one program, a tensor with key `tensor1` was put on the DB, then each replica of the program would put a tensor with the key `tensor1`. SmartSim and SmartRedis can avoid key collision by prepending program-unique prefixes to entities. \n",
