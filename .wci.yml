    headline: Machine learning workflows with HPC applications (Python, C++, C, and Fortran)

    description: SmartSim is a workflow library that makes it easier to use common
      Machine Learning (ML) libraries, like PyTorch and TensorFlow,
      in combination with High Performance Computing (HPC) simulations and applications.
      SmartSim launches ML infrastructure on HPC systems alongside user workloads
      and supports most HPC workload managers (e.g. Slurm, PBSPro, LSF, Cobalt).
      SmartSim also provides a set of client libraries in Python, C++, C, and Fortran.
      These client libraries allow users to send and receive data between user
      applications and the machine learning infrastructure.  Moreover, the
      client APIs enable the execution of machine learning tasks like inference
      and online training from within user code.  The exchange of data and
      execution of machine learning tasks is orchestrated by a high performance
      in-memory database that is launched and managed by SmartSim.
