    "# Train a Neural Network loading data from and to SmartSim\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will see how one can set up a workflow in which one or multiple processes produce data (e.g. in a simulation) and one or multiple processes consume the data to train a neural network. The key to achieve this behavior is to use SmartSim to load data from and to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial works on Slurm, but can easily be adapted to any supported Workload Manager (PBS, Cobalt, or LSF), with an only difference: in Slurm, we are allocating the resources *from* this Notebook, whereas with other WLMs, this Notebook has to be started *within* an existing allocation.\n",

    "## 1. First scenario: an ensemble of parallel producers and a single trainer\n",
    "\n",
    "The first use case is similar to a common workflow:\n",
    "- several copies of a simulation (possibly with different initializations) are running, each one consisting of multiple MPI ranks. Each rank produces samples (e.g. data points computed by the simulation) at regular intervals (e.g. each time iteration)\n",
    "- a neural network has to be trained on the data produced by the simulation, and as new data is produced, the neural network needs to add it to its training data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Workflow components\n",
    "We will use SmartSim to allow the exchange of data between the data-producing processes and the training service. Thus, the first component which we will need to launch is the `Orchestrator`. This is a fairly small example, thus we will run a single-node DB."
